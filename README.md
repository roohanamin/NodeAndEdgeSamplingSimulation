# NodeAndEdgeSamplingSimulation
Program is implemented in python and was compiled and ran in WSL. Latest versions of python may not run treelib properly. Go here: https://treelib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/# for installation instructions. I also used random.

Shown below is an example topology that has been created. This program is capable of creating any topology within the parameters from scratch.
